          <b>Valorant</b> is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person
          shooter set in the near-future.Players play as one of a set of agents,
          characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the
          world.In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the
          attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it.
          Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a
          unique ultimate ability which requires charging through kills, deaths,
          or spike actions. Every player starts each round with a "classic"
          pistol and one or more "signature ability" charge[2]. Other weapons
          and ability charges can be purchased using an in game economic system
          which awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any
          kills the player is responsible for, and any actions taken with the
          spike. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns
          like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine
          guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.[5][6] There are automatic and
          semi-automatic weapons that have a shooting pattern which has to be
          controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately.
